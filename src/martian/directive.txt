Directives New Style
====================

When grokking a class, the grokking procedure can be informed by
directives, on a class, or a module. If a directive is absent, the
system falls back to a default. Here we introduce a general way to
define these directives, and how to use them to retrieve information
for a class for use during the grokking procedure.

A simple directive
------------------

We define a simple directive that sets a description::

  >>> from martian import Directive, CLASS, ONCE
  >>> class description(Directive):
  ...     scope = CLASS
  ...     store = ONCE
  ...     default = u''

The name of the directive is ``description``. We specify that the
directive can only be used in the scope of a class. We also specify it
can only be used a single time. Finally we define the default in case
the directive is absent (the empty string).

Now we look at the directive in action::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...    description(u"This is a description")

After setting it, we can use the ``get`` method on the directive to
retrieve it from the class again::

  >>> description.get(Foo)
  u'This is a description'

Directives in different namespaces get stored differently. We'll
define a similar directive in another namespace::

  >>> class description2(description):
  ...     pass

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...     description(u"Description1")
  ...     description2(u"Description2")
  >>> description.get(Foo)
  u'Description1'
  >>> description2.get(Foo)
  u'Description2'

If we check the value of a class without the directive, we see the
default value for that directive, this case the empty unicode string::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...     pass
  >>> description.get(Foo)
  u''

In certain cases we need to set a value on a component as if the directive was
actually used::

  >>> description.set(Foo, u'value as set')
  >>> description.get(Foo)
  u'value as set'

Subclasses of the original class will inherit the properties set by the
directive:

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...     description('This is a foo.')
  ...
  >>> class Bar(Foo):
  ...     pass
  ...
  >>> description.get(Bar)
  'This is a foo.'

When we use the directive outside of class scope, we get an error
message::

  >>> description('Description')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  GrokImportError: The 'description' directive can only be used on class level.

In particular, we cannot use it in a module::

  >>> class testmodule(FakeModule):
  ...   fake_module = True
  ...   description("Description")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  GrokImportError: The 'description' directive can only be used on class level.

We cannot use the directive twice in the class scope. If we do so, we
get an error message as well::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...   description(u"Description1")
  ...   description(u"Description2")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  GrokImportError: The 'description' directive can only be called once per class.

We cannot call the directive with no argument either::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...   description()
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  TypeError: description takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)

Class and module scope
----------------------

We define a ``layer`` directive that can be used in class and module
scope both::

  >>> from martian import CLASS_OR_MODULE
  >>> class layer(Directive):
  ...     scope = CLASS_OR_MODULE
  ...     store = ONCE

By default, the ``default`` property is None which is why we can omit
specifying it here.

We can use this directive now on a class::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...   layer('Test')
  >>> layer.get(Foo)
  'Test'

The defaulting to ``None`` works::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...   pass
  >>> layer.get(Foo) is None
  True

We can also use it in a module::

  >>> class testmodule(FakeModule):
  ...    layer('Test2')
  ...    class Foo(object):
  ...       pass
  >>> test_module = fake_import(testmodule)

When we now try to access ``layer`` on ``Foo``, we find the
module-level default which we just set. We pass the module as the
second argument to the ``get`` method to have it fall back on this::

  >>> layer.get(testmodule.Foo, testmodule)
  'Test2'

Let's look at a module where the directive is not used::

  >>> class testmodule(FakeModule):
  ...   class Foo(object):
  ...      pass
  >>> testmodule = fake_import(testmodule)

In this case, the value cannot be found so the system falls back on
the default, ``None``::

  >>> layer.get(testmodule.Foo, testmodule) is None
  True

Using a directive multiple times
--------------------------------

A directive can be configured to allow it to be called multiple times
in the same scope::

  >>> from martian import MultipleTimesDirective
  >>> class multi(MultipleTimesDirective):
  ...     scope = CLASS

We can now use the directive multiple times without any errors::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...   multi(u"Once")
  ...   multi(u"Twice")

We can now retrieve the value and we'll get a list::

  >>> multi.get(Foo)
  [u'Once', u'Twice']

The default value for a MultipleTimesDirective is an empty list::

  >>> class Bar(object):
  ...   pass
  >>> multi.get(Bar)
  []

Whenever the directive is used on a sub class of a component, the values set by
directives on the base classes are concatenated::

  >>> class Qux(Foo):
  ...     multi(u'Triple')
  ...
  >>> multi.get(Qux)
  [u'Once', u'Twice', u'Triple']


Using a directive multiple times, as a dictionary
-------------------------------------------------

A directive can be configured to allow it to be called multiple times in the
same scope. In this case the factory method should be overridden to return a
key-value pair::

  >>> from martian import DICT
  >>> class multi(Directive):
  ...     scope = CLASS
  ...     store = DICT
  ...     def factory(self, value):
  ...         return value.lower(), value

We can now use the directive multiple times without any errors::

  >>> class Bar(object):
  ...   multi(u"Once")
  ...   multi(u"Twice")

We can now retrieve the value and we'll get a to the items::

  >>> d = multi.get(Bar)
  >>> print sorted(d.items())
  [(u'once', u'Once'), (u'twice', u'Twice')]

When the factory method does not return a key-value pair, an error is raised::

  >>> class wrongmulti(Directive):
  ...     scope = CLASS
  ...     store = DICT
  ...     def factory(self, value):
  ...         return None

  >>> class Baz(object):
  ...   wrongmulti(u"Once")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  GrokImportError: The factory method for the 'wrongmulti' directive should
  return a key-value pair.

  >>> class wrongmulti2(Directive):
  ...     scope = CLASS
  ...     store = DICT
  ...     def factory(self, value):
  ...         return value, value, value

  >>> class Baz(object):
  ...   wrongmulti2(u"Once")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  GrokImportError: The factory method for the 'wrongmulti2' directive should
  return a key-value pair.

  >>> class multi(Directive):
  ...     scope = CLASS
  ...     store = DICT
  ...     def factory(self, value, andanother):
  ...         return value, andanother
  ...
  >>> class Frepple(object):
  ...   multi(1, 'AAA')
  ...   multi(2, 'BBB')
  ...
  >>> class Fropple(Frepple):
  ...   multi(1, 'CCC')
  ...   multi(3, 'DDD')
  ...   multi(4, 'EEE')

  >>> d = multi.get(Fropple)
  >>> print sorted(d.items())
  [(1, 'CCC'), (2, 'BBB'), (3, 'DDD'), (4, 'EEE')]

Calculated defaults
-------------------

Often instead of just supplying the system with a default, we want to
calculate the default in some way. We define the ``name`` directive,
which if not present, will calculate its value from the name of class,
lower-cased. Instead of passing a default value, we pass a function as the
default argument::

  >>> class name(Directive):
  ...     scope = CLASS
  ...     store = ONCE
  ...     def get_default(self, component):
  ...         return component.__name__.lower()

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...   name('bar')
  >>> name.get(Foo)
  'bar'

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...   pass
  >>> name.get(Foo)
  'foo'

A marker directive
------------------

Another type of directive is a marker directive. This directive takes
no arguments at all, but when used it marks the context::

  >>> from martian import MarkerDirective
  >>> class mark(MarkerDirective):
  ...     scope = CLASS

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...     mark()

Class ``Foo`` is now marked::

  >>> mark.get(Foo)
  True

When we have a class that isn't marked, we get the default value, ``False``::

  >>> class Bar(object):
  ...    pass
  >>> mark.get(Bar)
  False

If we pass in an argument, we get an error::

  >>> class Bar(object):
  ...   mark("An argument")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  TypeError: mark takes no arguments (1 given)


Validation
----------

A directive can be supplied with a validation method. The validation method
checks whether the value passed in is allowed. It should raise
``GrokImportError`` if the value cannot be validated, together with a
description of why not.

First we define our own validation function. A validation function
takes two arguments:

* the name of the directive we're validating for

* the value we need to validate

The name can be used to format the exception properly.

We'll define a validation method that only expects integer numbers::

  >>> from martian.error import GrokImportError
  >>> class number(Directive):
  ...     scope = CLASS
  ...     store = ONCE
  ...     def validate(self, value):
  ...         if type(value) is not int:
  ...             raise GrokImportError("The '%s' directive can only be called with an integer." %
  ...                                   self.name)

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...    number(3)

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...    number("This shouldn't work")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  GrokImportError: The 'number' directive can only be called with an integer.

Some built-in validation functions
----------------------------------

Let's look at some built-in validation functions.

The ``validateText`` function determines whether a string
is unicode or plain ascii::

  >>> from martian import validateText
  >>> class title(Directive):
  ...     scope = CLASS
  ...     store = ONCE
  ...     default = u''
  ...     validate = validateText

When we pass ascii text into the directive, there is no error::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...    title('Some ascii text')

We can also pass in a unicode string without error::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...    title(u'Some unicode text')

Let's now try it with something that's not text at all, such as a number.
This fails::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...    title(123)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  GrokImportError: The 'title' directive can only be called with unicode or ASCII.

It's not allowed to call the direct with a non-ascii encoded string::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...   title(u'è'.encode('latin-1'))
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  GrokImportError: The 'title' directive can only be called with unicode or ASCII.

 >>> class Foo(object):
 ...   title(u'è'.encode('UTF-8'))
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
 GrokImportError: The 'title' directive can only be called with unicode or ASCII.

The ``validateInterfaceOrClass`` function only accepts class or
interface objects::

  >>> from martian import validateInterfaceOrClass
  >>> class klass(Directive):
  ...     scope = CLASS
  ...     store = ONCE
  ...     validate = validateInterfaceOrClass

It works with interfaces and classes::

  >>> class Bar(object):
  ...    pass
  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...    klass(Bar)

  >>> from zope.interface import Interface
  >>> class IBar(Interface):
  ...    pass
  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...    klass(IBar)

It won't work with other things::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...   klass(Bar())
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  GrokImportError: The 'klass' directive can only be called with a class or an interface.

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...   klass(1)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  GrokImportError: The 'klass' directive can only be called with a class or an interface.

The ``validateInterface`` validator only accepts an interface::

  >>> from martian import validateInterface
  >>> class iface(Directive):
  ...     scope = CLASS
  ...     store = ONCE
  ...     validate = validateInterface

Let's try it::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...    iface(IBar)

It won't work with classes or other things::

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...   iface(Bar)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  GrokImportError: The 'iface' directive can only be called with an interface.

  >>> class Foo(object):
  ...   iface(1)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  GrokImportError: The 'iface' directive can only be called with an interface.

Declaring base classes
----------------------

There's a special directive called 'baseclass' which lets you declare that a
certain class is the base class for a series of other components.  This
property should not be inherited by those components.  Consider the following
base class:

  >>> from martian import baseclass
  >>> class MyBase(object):
  ...     baseclass()

As you would expect, the directive will correctly identify this class as a
baseclass:

  >>> baseclass.get(MyBase)
  True

But, if we create a subclass of this base class, the subclass won't inherit
that property, unlike with a regular directive:

  >>> class SubClass(MyBase):
  ...     pass
  ...
  >>> baseclass.get(SubClass)
  False

Naturally, the directive will also report a false answer if the class doesn't
inherit from a base class at all and hasn't been marked with the directive:

  >>> class NoBase(object):
  ...     pass
  ...
  >>> baseclass.get(NoBase)
  False
